Hiring a screenwriter or script doctor is, therefore, a way to fast track such collaboration. It puts you into contact with a professional specifically selected by a specialist screenwriting organisation (such as Industrial Scripts) who will know how to get the best out of your work. They’ll show you things that you can’t see yourself.</p>
